DESCRIPTION OF TASK 2:
During my internship at CODTECH, I successfully completed Task 2, which involved developing an automated report generation system using Python. I carried out this task entirely using the Jupyter Notebook platform, which is a powerful and interactive Python-based coding environment ideal for data analysis, scripting, and visualization. The goal of the task was to read data from an Excel file, analyze it, and generate a well-structured PDF report using Python libraries. I started by creating an Excel file named data.xlsx that contained tabular data with columns like NAME, DEPT, and SCORE. I uploaded this file to my Jupyter environment and used the pandas library to read and process the data. Pandas is widely used for data manipulation and analysis. After reading the file with pd.read_excel(), I used the describe() function to generate summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency count. Then, I used the FPDF library, which is a lightweight tool for creating PDFs in Python. I added the necessary headers, iterated through each column of the data summary, and wrote it to a PDF file in a clean and readable format. I made sure to handle text and numerical columns appropriately and to avoid displaying NaN values where they were not applicable. Finally, I saved the generated report as report.pdf, which could be downloaded and used as a professional output file. This task helped me understand the flow of reading and analyzing structured data, summarizing insights, and exporting it into a presentable format. It also gave me hands-on experience with essential Python libraries used in data science and automation. The task is highly applicable in real-world domains such as business analytics, automated reporting in HR systems, sales performance dashboards, academic grading systems, and more. Any organization that deals with repetitive reporting tasks can use such scripts to automate their report generation, saving time and ensuring consistency. The tools I used include Jupyter Notebook as the coding interface, Microsoft Excel to create and organize the data, and the Python libraries pandas and fpdf for data processing and PDF generation. I also used simple Python functions for formatting and validation. This experience has greatly improved my confidence in working with data automation projects and strengthened my practical understanding of using Python in real-world scenarios. It also taught me how to troubleshoot common issues such as file not found errors, NaN handling, and formatting challenges in PDF reports. Completing this task independently with step-by-step debugging and testing helped enhance my problem-solving skills and made me more efficient in writing clean and logical code. Overall, this internship task provided valuable experience that connects theoretical knowledge with industry-relevant applications, and it has motivated me to further explore Python for automation, data science, and intelligent systems development.
